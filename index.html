<p>➤ X-axis: Median household income</p>
<p>Each dot’s horizontal position represents the estimated income for that census tract (from $20,000 to $250,000 in the example).</p>
<p>➤ Y-axis: Largest group in Census tract</p>
<p>This is a categorical axis showing the racial group that is the largest in each tract (White, Hispanic, Black, or Asian).</p>
<p>Each row corresponds to one of these groups.</p>
<p>➤ Facets (Small Multiples): Each panel (strip) represents a borough of NYC:</p>
<p>Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island</p>
<p>So you’re seeing the same kind of plot repeated for each borough, which helps compare across them.</p>
